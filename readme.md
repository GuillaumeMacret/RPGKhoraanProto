# RPG prototype

Khoraan is a fantasy RPG universe created by a bunch of nerds in their cave. Half serious half troll, you can find resources about this world at [the following url](https://norcisrasp.ddns.net/jdrpz) (sorry it's in french and I like baguette :baguette_bread:).

The nerdiest nerds of the group decided that it would be fun to try to develop a video game based on this universe. This repo is a pre-pre-alpha of what Khoraan video game will be.

## Technologies
